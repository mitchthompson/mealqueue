# Introduction 

Meal Queue is a meal planning app that I was inspired to make from my own experience. I like to cook but with a busy schedule I would find that when it was time to cook I would be missing key ingredients for a recipe. Meal Queue allows the user to enter, edit, and import recipes from websites then create a calendar of meals. Once some meals are planned the user can dynamically create a grocery list with ingredients from recipes in the meal plan. Meal Queue is a Java-based android app using Firebase for the database with Google Sign-on and Facebook Login integration.
